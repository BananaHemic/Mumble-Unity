# Mumble-Unity

A simple to use Mumble Client made for Unity3D.
Easily send low-latency text and voice to a group of other users

## Features

* End-to-End OCB/AES encryption
* Client-to-server architecture allowing far more scalability than peer-to-peer
* Opus codec support, allowing lightweight low latency HD voice communication
* Open source server
* Extensible server, allowing you to create the permissions structure best suited for your application
* Works with other Mumble clients out of the box, provided that they use the opus codec
* Works with any opus-compatible Mumble SDK, including sdks for:
  * [C++](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble)
  * [Objective-C](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumblekit)
  * [Android/Java](https://github.com/pcgod/mumble-android)
  * [Ruby](https://github.com/mattvperry/mumble-ruby)
  * [Python](https://github.com/frymaster/mumbleclient)
  * [C#](https://github.com/martindevans/MumbleSharp)
  * [NodeJS](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-mumble)
  * Probably some others that I've forgotten to mention
* Cross platform

## Limitations

* Only the Opus codec is supported, meaning very old mumble clients may be unable to connect
* Requires a (free) Mumble server

## Getting started

### Get a server

   Either get a Mumble server at [one of the many Mumble server hosts](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Hosters).
Or you can [setup your own Mumble server](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Installing_Mumble) (which I recommend)

   If you do make your own server, be sure to set "opusthreshold=0" in mumble-server.ini or murmur.ini in order to make all clients use opus

### Installing

**Method 1: using UnityNuGet + OpenUPM scope registry**

1. Add the [UnityNuget](https://github.com/xoofx/UnityNuGet) scope registry:

```
https://github.com/xoofx/UnityNuGet#add-scope-registry-manifestjson
```

2. Follow the steps in `Manual installation`: https://openupm.com/packages/com.bananahemic.mumble/

**Method 2: Manually**

   * If your Unity project is *not* currently tracked with git, then you can navigate to your project's "Assets" folder and run
   `git clone https://github.com/BananaHemic/Mumble-Unity.git`
   * If your project *is* already tracked with git, you can add this projects as a submodule by navigating to the "Assets" folder and running
   `git submodule add https://github.com/BananaHemic/Mumble-Unity.git`
   * Then, simply open the included example scene, and input your Mumble server's address into "MumbleTester"

### Integration

   * To begin integrating into your application, you can copy "MumbleTester.cs" and adapt the functions to best meet your individual needs
   * For instance, if you would like to make the audio come from an object (like a person's head) you can change the `CreateMumbleAudioPlayerFromPrefab` method to create the prefab as a child of your target object

## TODO

1. Better support multiple audio per packet sizes (20ms is currently assumed)
2. Switch to TCP without sending voice packets
3. Get Opus libraries for iOS
4. Get Opus libraries for Linux
